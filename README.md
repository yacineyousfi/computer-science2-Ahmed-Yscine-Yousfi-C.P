## Project 1 – Basic Python Commands  
This project focused on fundamental Python concepts such as variables, user input, calculations, conditionals, and loops. It provided a foundation in writing simple, structured Python programs.

## Project 2 – Banking System  
A basic banking application was developed to simulate login functionality and allow users to check balances, deposit, or withdraw funds. The project emphasized control structures, validation, and user interaction.

## Project 3 – Movie Library System  
A program was created to manage a list of movies, with features for adding entries, listing all movies, and searching by title. Lists, dictionaries, and functions were used to structure the application effectively.

## Project 4 – Budget Tracker  
This project involved building a tool to log and manage income and expenses, with capabilities to add, delete, and edit entries. A total balance summary was included. The logic relied on lists of dictionaries and modular functions.

## Project 5 – Restaurant Ordering System  
An object-oriented system was implemented to allow users to view a menu, place orders, and receive a receipt with the total cost. The project utilized classes and objects to demonstrate core OOP principles in Python.

## Project 6 – Movie Data Analysis with Pandas  
A dataset of movies was analyzed using the pandas library. The program included operations such as filtering, computing averages and profits, and grouping by genre and director. The focus was on data handling and analysis using Python.
